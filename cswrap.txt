NAME
----
cswrap - generic compiler wrapper


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cswrap* ['--help']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
cswrap is a generic compiler wrapper that translates relative paths to absolute
paths in diagnostic messages.  Create a symbolic link to cswrap named as your
compiler (gcc, g++, ...) and put it to your $PATH.

Translated diagnostic messages are decorated by suffix *\<--[TOOL]* if they
are produced by a tool named *TOOL* (given by cswrap invokation via symlink
named *TOOL*).  This only applies to translated diagnostic messages, which
does not include code snippets, for instance.


OPTIONS
-------
*--help*::
    Prints basic usage information.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
cswrap propagates the exit status returned by the compiler (in case cswrap
succeeds to run the compiler).


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*CSWRAP_CAP_FILE*::
    If set to a non-empty string, cswrap captures diagnostic messages into a
    file named *$CSWRAP_CAP_FILE*.  In this case, the capture file is
    protected by a lock named */cswrap_cap_file_lock* in order to obtain
    consistent output when running multiple compiler processes in parallel.

*CSWRAP_TIMEOUT*::
    If set to a positive integer, cswrap installs a timeout for the compiler
    being wrapped.  If the specified amount of time (given in seconds) elapses
    the compiler process is signalled by SIGTERM.  Note the cswrap process
    waits till the compiler process finishes in any case.

*CSWRAP_DEL_CFLAGS*, *CSWRAP_DEL_CXXFLAGS*::
    cswrap expects a colon-separated list of compiler flags that should be
    removed from command line prior to invoking the compiler.  The parameters
    are matched for exact match and they are case-sensitive.  If a compiler
    flag appears in the command line multiple times, all its occurrences are
    removed.  *$CSWRAP_DEL_CFLAGS* applies to compilation of C sources only.
    *$CSWRAP_DEL_CXXFLAGS* applies to compilation of C++ sources only.

*CSWRAP_ADD_CFLAGS*, *CSWRAP_ADD_CXXFLAGS*::
    cswrap expects a colon-separated list of compiler flags that should be
    appended to command line prior to invoking the compiler.  The flags are
    appended even if they already appear in the command line and they are
    always appended on the end of the command line.  *$CSWRAP_ADD_CFLAGS*
    applies to compilation of C sources only.  *$CSWRAP_ADD_CXXFLAGS* applies
    to compilation of C++ sources only.
